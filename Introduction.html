            Hi, I am Khriekono Chucha, a CSE student. I'm from Nagaland, state known for diverse indigenous tribes and vibrant culture. <br>
            I completed my secondary education in Visakhapatnam after graduating from school in Delhi. <br>
            I signed up for this course because I'm interested in computer and coding, even though I had no idea what to expect. I'm hoping to learn from it and be able to apply it to situations in real life, not simply because it looks cool or sounds fascinating. <br>
            
            My hobbies are
            <ul>
                <li>Playing Sports</li>
                <li>Gaming</li>
                <li>Dancing</li>
                <li>Exploring</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        This is one of the website that I like as I'm interested in trying their food. <br>
